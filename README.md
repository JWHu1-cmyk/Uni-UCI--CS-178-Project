● Led an image classification study on the Fashion-MNIST dataset utilizing kNN, logistic regression, feedforward neural networks, and support vector classifier (SVC).
● Directed the implementation and tuning of feedforward neural networks using NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, achieving 89.6% accuracy with efficient prediction times.
● Achieved a 90.5% test accuracy with SVC through optimal hyperparameter tuning.
● Performed extensive model evaluation, including confusion matrix analysis, classifier prediction time comparisons, and identifying weaknesses in distinguishing visually similar categories like T-shirts, shirts, and pullovers.
